# Project: Breast cancer
#### Introduction:

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, nearly 1.7 million new cases were diagnosed in 2012 according to International Agency for Research on Cancer. Breast cancer is now the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the world's developing regions. Even the majority of new breast cancer diagnoses and deaths occur in countries in developing, the rate of breast cancer per 100,000 women is higher in the United State of America (U.S.A), Canada and Europe. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease.  

#### My biological questions were:

1.- Are there differences in the Rate of breast cancer mortality in women in these risk factor groups? (slide 3)

2.- Is there a relation between obesity and the breast cancer mortality? (slide 4)

3.- Is there a relation between the income and the breast cancer mortality in women? (slide 5)
